The data are artificially generated for the purpose of illustration. The variables are:\
y = dependent variable repeatedly measured over time,\
time = time of measurement (0, 1, â€¦, 5),\
w2 = a time-varying covariate repeatedly measured over time, and\
z1 = a time-invariant covariate measured at time 0.
